**Description**

StudyVocab allows you to save and study vocabulary in various ways. Currently, you can create up to 5 dictionaries, add vocabulary to them, and study them separately. You also have the option to include a context for a word, which serves as a hint during the studying process.

The tg-bot has been [deployed](https://t.me/StudyVocabot) and is ready for use. I plan to develop a frontend with Telegram OAuth and backend API routes to enhance user functionality, as the UI of the Telegram bot is somewhat limited.

**Packages**
1. Tg-bot - Telegram bot for storing and studing vocabulary (StudyVocabot).
2. Backend - API endpoints for managing user dictionaries and words from a frontend (currently unfinished and not in use).
3. Frontend - not yet built

**Tech stack**
1. Typescript
2. Express.js (backend package)
3. Grammy (tg-bot package)
4. MongoDB
5. Mongoose ODM
6. Tsup
